# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core object detection and table calibration system for snooker video analytics. It provides the foundation for automated ball detection, classification, and table geometry understanding that enables accurate tracking and scoring in both live and recorded snooker matches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a snooker analytics system, I want to detect and classify all balls on the table, so that I can track their positions and movements for scoring purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video frame contains snooker balls THEN the system SHALL detect each visible ball with at least 85% accuracy
2. WHEN a ball is detected THEN the system SHALL classify it as one of: cue ball, red ball, yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, or black ball
3. WHEN multiple balls are present THEN the system SHALL detect and classify each ball independently
4. IF a ball is partially occluded THEN the system SHALL still attempt detection with confidence scoring
5. WHEN lighting conditions vary THEN the system SHALL maintain detection accuracy across different lighting scenarios

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a snooker analytics system, I want to understand the table geometry and perspective, so that I can accurately map ball positions and movements in real-world coordinates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video frame shows a snooker table THEN the system SHALL detect the table boundaries and corners
2. WHEN table corners are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate homography transformation matrix
3. WHEN homography is established THEN the system SHALL convert pixel coordinates to real-world table coordinates
4. IF the camera angle changes THEN the system SHALL recalibrate the table geometry automatically
5. WHEN table detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback using previous calibration data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a snooker analytics system, I want to track ball movements over time, so that I can determine shot outcomes and ball trajectories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN balls move between frames THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent tracking IDs for each ball
2. WHEN a ball disappears temporarily THEN the system SHALL predict its position and attempt to reacquire tracking
3. WHEN balls collide or cross paths THEN the system SHALL maintain separate tracking for each ball
4. WHEN a ball is potted THEN the system SHALL detect the disappearance and mark the ball as potted
5. IF tracking is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reinitialize tracking using detection data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the detection system, I want a clean API interface, so that I can easily access detection results and calibration data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detection is performed THEN the system SHALL provide ball positions in both pixel and table coordinates
2. WHEN calibration is complete THEN the system SHALL expose transformation matrices and table dimensions
3. WHEN processing video THEN the system SHALL provide frame-by-frame detection results with timestamps
4. IF detection confidence is low THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores in the output
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the detection system to handle both live and recorded video inputs, so that the system can work with different video sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provided with a live video stream THEN the system SHALL process frames in real-time with minimal latency
2. WHEN provided with a recorded video file THEN the system SHALL process the entire video and provide batch results
3. WHEN switching between input types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent detection accuracy
4. IF video quality is poor THEN the system SHALL adjust detection parameters automatically
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with remaining frames

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want the system to provide debugging and visualization capabilities, so that I can verify detection accuracy and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL overlay detection bounding boxes on video frames
2. WHEN calibration is active THEN the system SHALL visualize detected table corners and boundaries
3. WHEN tracking is running THEN the system SHALL display ball trajectories and tracking IDs
4. IF detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about failure reasons
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL save annotated frames for manual review
