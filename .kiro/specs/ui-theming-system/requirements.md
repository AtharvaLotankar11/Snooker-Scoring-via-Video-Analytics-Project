# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive UI theming system for the snooker analysis web application that adheres to strict brand guidelines. The system will support both light and dark themes while maintaining consistency with the defined brand colors and philosophy. The implementation will replace the current ad-hoc styling with a structured, maintainable theming system that reflects the energetic, playful, and motivating tone of the sports analytics platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between light and dark themes so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions and according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a theme toggle control in the navigation bar
2. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately switch between light and dark themes without page refresh
3. WHEN the user switches themes THEN the system SHALL persist the theme preference in local storage
4. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL automatically apply their previously selected theme
5. IF no theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL default to the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want the application to strictly follow the defined color palette so that the brand identity remains consistent across all interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any UI element THEN the system SHALL use only the approved brand colors: Blue (#0B405B) and Neon Green (#94D82A)
2. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL follow the primary and secondary color approach with Blue as primary and Neon Green as secondary
3. WHEN creating color variations THEN the system SHALL derive lighter/darker shades from the base brand colors using consistent mathematical formulas
4. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use brand colors for hover, focus, and active states
5. IF additional colors are needed THEN the system SHALL use neutral grays that complement the brand palette

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to reflect the energetic and playful sports theme so that the application feels engaging and motivating to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text content THEN the system SHALL use energetic, playful, and motivating language that reflects sports competition spirit
2. WHEN showing UI animations THEN the system SHALL include subtle, sports-inspired motion effects that enhance engagement
3. WHEN displaying buttons and interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use dynamic styling that conveys energy and action
4. WHEN presenting data visualizations THEN the system SHALL incorporate sports-themed visual metaphors where appropriate
5. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL display engaging loading states that maintain the energetic theme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theming system so that I can easily maintain and update the visual design across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing themes THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties (variables) for all color definitions
2. WHEN organizing theme files THEN the system SHALL separate light and dark theme configurations into distinct, maintainable files
3. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL provide theme-aware utility classes and mixins
4. WHEN updating brand colors THEN the system SHALL require changes only in the central theme configuration files
5. IF theme inconsistencies occur THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools to detect and report violations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the theming system to support high contrast and reduced motion preferences so that I can use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has high contrast preferences enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically apply enhanced contrast ratios
2. WHEN the user has reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL disable or minimize animations and transitions
3. WHEN displaying any text THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios in both light and dark themes
4. WHEN focusing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clearly visible focus indicators that meet accessibility standards
5. IF color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide alternative indicators (icons, patterns, text)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logo and brand assets to be properly integrated so that the application maintains professional brand consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the application logo THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate logo variant based on the current theme (light/dark)
2. WHEN showing brand assets THEN the system SHALL maintain proper logo sizing, spacing, and positioning according to brand guidelines
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to the corresponding logo variant
4. WHEN displaying the logo on different backgrounds THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast and visibility
5. IF logo assets are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to text-based branding with proper styling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the theming system to work consistently across desktop, tablet, and mobile so that I have a unified experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on any device THEN the system SHALL apply themes consistently across all screen sizes
2. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL maintain theme integrity while adapting layout responsively
3. WHEN using touch interactions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch-friendly styling for themed elements
4. WHEN displaying on high-DPI screens THEN the system SHALL ensure crisp rendering of all themed visual elements
5. IF device capabilities vary THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade advanced theming features while maintaining core functionality
